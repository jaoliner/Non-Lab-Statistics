# Non-Lab-Statistics

## Overview
This repository highlights my work in Dr. Non's Epigenetic Anthropology Lab at UCSD, featuring teaching materials, example analyses, and applied research methodologies in statistical modeling, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis. It showcases practical approaches to longitudinal and multivariate analyses of population-level data and demonstrates methods I've applied in both ongoing research projects and student mentorship.

## Statistical Analyses
- Samples of published and in-progress analyses, demonstrating statistical workflows in R to be generalized to multiple projects. Workflows cover data manipulation/visualization, regression and factor analyses, and longitudinal inference/visualizations. Due to confidentiality of ongoing projects, analyses are presented without identifiable variable or data set names. **Full analyses and results are available upon request**.
- Projects cover the longitudinal effects of social determinants on individual-level and neighborhood-level health outcomes including, but not limited, chronic obstructive pulmonary diease risk factors, preterm birth indicators, and fetal death determinants.




## Teaching and Workshops
- Graduate-level methylation and stress analysis coding notebooks, developed and used as part of a workshop for 20+ graduate and undergraduate students in 2024 and 2025. These notebooks demonstrate hands-on workflows for epigenetic data analysis, including data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization.
- Sample R workflow using CDC birth data to explore preterm birth and NICU admission rates within large data sets, demonstrating data cleaning, merging, and visualization techniques to tackle longitudinal research questions.
